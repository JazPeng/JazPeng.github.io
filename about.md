# A little about me
I am a Senior Data Analyst with three years' experience. I work with Microsoft Excel, SQL, Python and R and have experience working with visualisation tools such as Tableau.

I started my career working at **Stack Overflow**, where I worked for 3.5 years. During this period I worked across three different roles in different departments, with each role more technical than the last. My role as Customer Success Representative required some basic data analysis and Excel skills, by the time I moved to Insights Consultant I was competent in data manipulation and visualisation in R and Python. I moved onto Data Analyst at **DAZN**, where I focused on product analysis, creating dashboards and some modelling. I now currently work as a Senior Analyst for **Expedia**.

My Data Analyst career has been closely intertwined with the global education institution **General Assembly**. My first interaction with the company was as a student of the *Data Analytics* course. As my interest in data grew, I moved on to become a graduate of the *Data Science* course. I am proud to currently be a General Assembly Instructor for the *Data Analytics* course and the *Intro to Data Analytics* bootcamp, as well as Teaching Assistant for the *Data Science* course. I love encountering the young, curious minds that remind me of myself when I began and I learn something new myself with every class.

I love anything data-related and am always looking to improve. I am constantly completing DataCamp and Coursera courses, and from October 2018 I am studying for a *Professional Certificate in Practical Statistics* from Open University.

# About this site
This is a collection of some of my work. They are the results of speaking at conferences, final projects for courses or just subjects I'm interested in. I like using both R and Python so my projects are made of both. If you have any questions or suggestions on how to improve, please feel free to reach out - I am always keen to meet other members of the data science community!
